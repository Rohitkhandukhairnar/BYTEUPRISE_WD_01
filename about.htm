                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my corner of the web! My name is Rohit Khairnar, and I’m a passionate student with a knack for web development. Currently enrolled in GTU, I’ve embarked on a journey to explore the vast world of technology and creativity.<br>
                    Driven by my love for innovation and design, I’ve taken to crafting websites as a medium to express my ideas and share my interests with the world. Leveraging platforms like WordPress, I’ve honed my skills in web development, mastering the art of creating engaging and functional online experiences.<br>
                    In this digital age, I believe that the internet serves as a powerful tool for connection and expression. Through my website projects, I aspire to not only showcase my capabilities but also contribute meaningfully to the online community.<br>
                    Join me as I continue to learn, grow, and explore the limitless possibilities of web development. Whether you’re here to admire my work, seek inspiration, or collaborate on a project, I’m excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts and make a mark in the ever-evolving realm of the web.<br>
                    Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear from you!<br>
